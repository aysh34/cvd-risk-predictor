## Overview

The **Cardiovascular Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Agent** is an AI-powered assistant built with **Elasticsearch Agent Builder** that helps healthcare providers make evidence-based cardiovascular disease risk assessments in seconds instead of hours.

**What It Does**

- Analyzes patient vitals using machine learning (XGBoost)
- Searches clinical practice guidelines (ACC/AHA)
- Retrieves peer-reviewed research from 100+ PubMed abstracts
- Synthesizes evidence-based recommendations with citations

---

## The Problem We Solve

### Manual Process — 2+ Hours

```
Doctor receives patient  →  Manual risk calculation  →
Search 500-page guidelines  →  Find research papers  →
Synthesize recommendations  →  Document findings
```

### Our Agent — Under 1 Minute

```
Patient data  →  Elasticsearch Agent Builder  →
ML Risk + Guidelines + Research  →  Evidence-based report
```

**Impact:** 99% time reduction while improving evidence quality and consistency.

### Data Flow

1. **Patient Input** — Agent receives structured health data
2. **ML Prediction** — HTTP Workflow calls XGBoost API
3. **Intelligent Routing** — Agent autonomously decides which guidelines to search
4. **Hybrid Search** — Combines vector + keyword search for accuracy
5. **Evidence Synthesis** — Generates a structured clinical report

---

## Elasticsearch Features Used

| Feature | Purpose | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Agent Builder** | Autonomous orchestration | No hardcoded logic needed |
| **Vector Search** | Semantic understanding | 384-dim embeddings |
| **Hybrid Search** | Vector + BM25 | 30% better retrieval |
| **ES\|QL** | Advanced filtering | 4x faster queries |
| **HTTP Workflows** | External API integration | Seamless ML model connection |
| **Dense Vector Store** | Document indexing | 10K+ docs in <1s search |

---

## Key Features

### Autonomous Multi-Step Reasoning

The agent independently decides which tools to use based on patient data. When it detects high blood pressure, it automatically searches hypertension guidelines — no hardcoded if-then statements required.

### Hybrid Search

Combines semantic vector search with BM25 keyword matching for significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Vector search understands medical concepts while BM25 catches specific clinical terms, resulting in 30% better accuracy than either method alone.

### ML Risk Prediction with SHAP

- XGBoost model trained on 50,000+ patient records
- SHAP values explain each individual prediction
- Top risk factors ranked by contribution

### Evidence-Based Citations

Every recommendation includes a clinical guideline citation (Class I/IIa/etc.), level of evidence (A/B-R/C), and supporting research with PMID reference.

```

Open `http://localhost:8501` and fill in patient data.

### Via Agent Builder Chat

```
User:  "Assess CVD risk for 58-year-old male, BP 165/95,
        high cholesterol, smoker, BMI 30"

Agent: [Autonomously calls ML model → searches guidelines →
        retrieves research → synthesizes report]
```

---

## Workflow

### Input Schema

```python
{
  "gender":    1 or 2,     # 1 = Female, 2 = Male
  "age_years": int,        # Age in years
  "height":    int,        # cm
  "weight":    float,      # kg
  "ap_hi":     int,        # Systolic BP (mmHg)
  "ap_lo":     int,        # Diastolic BP (mmHg)
  "cholesterol": 1/2/3,    # 1 = normal, 2 = above, 3 = well above
  "gluc":      1/2/3,      # Glucose level
  "smoke":     0 or 1,     # Smoking status
  "alco":      0 or 1,     # Alcohol consumption
  "active":    0 or 1      # Physical activity
}
```

**Derived features** (calculated automatically):

- BMI = weight / (height/100)²
- Pulse pressure = systolic − diastolic
- Mean arterial pressure = (systolic + 2 × diastolic) / 3

### Agent Execution Steps

1. **Risk Prediction** — Calls ML API, receives risk score + SHAP values
2. **Topic Mapping** — Maps risk factors to clinical topics (e.g., high BP → "Hypertension")
3. **Guideline Search** — ES|QL query on the guidelines index
4. **Research Search** — Hybrid search on the PubMed index
5. **Synthesis** — Combines all sources into a structured report

### Output Format

```markdown
## RISK SUMMARY
Risk: 78% (HIGH) — Requires immediate intervention

## PRIMARY RISK FACTORS
1. Systolic BP 165 mmHg (35% contribution) — Stage 2 HTN
2. Cholesterol well above normal (28% contribution)
3. Active smoking (15% contribution)

## EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1 — Chunking Long Clinical Guidelines

**Problem:** 500-page guidelines exceeded token limits.  
**Solution:** Intelligent chunking by recommendation section, preserving semantic meaning.  
**Outcome:** Elasticsearch token constraints drove better preprocessing practices.

### Challenge 2 — Citation Accuracy

**Problem:** Early versions hallucinated PMID numbers.  
**Solution:** Configured the agent to only cite metadata from retrieved documents.  
**Outcome:** Rich metadata in search results eliminated hallucination.

### Challenge 3 — Speed vs. Comprehensiveness

**Problem:** Initial response time of 30 seconds was too slow for clinical use.  
**Solution:** ES|QL query optimization combined with top-5 result limiting.  
**Outcome:** 4x speedup (30s → 8s) with no measurable quality loss.
