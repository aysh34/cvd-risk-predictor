## 🔍 Overview

The **Cardiovascular Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Agent** is an AI-powered assistant built with **Elasticsearch Agent Builder** that helps healthcare providers make evidence-based cardiovascular disease risk assessments in seconds instead of hours.

### What It Does

✅ **Analyzes** patient vitals using machine learning (XGBoost)  
✅ **Searches** clinical practice guidelines (ACC/AHA)  
✅ **Retrieves** peer-reviewed research (10,000+ PubMed abstracts)  
✅ **Synthesizes** evidence-based recommendations with citations  

### What It Doesn't Do

❌ Does **not** diagnose or prescribe treatment  
❌ Does **not** replace physician judgment  
✅ Provides **structured decision support** with transparent reasoning

## 🚨 The Problem We Solve

<div align="center">

### Manual Process: 2+ Hours ⏰

```
Doctor receives patient → Manual risk calculation → 
Search 500-page guidelines → Find research papers → 
Synthesize recommendations → Document findings
```

### Our Agent: 8 Seconds ⚡

```
Patient data → Elasticsearch Agent Builder → 
ML Risk + Guidelines + Research → Evidence-based report
```

</div>

**Impact:** 99% time reduction while improving evidence quality and consistency

### Data Flow

1. **Patient Input** → Agent receives structured health data
2. **ML Prediction** → HTTP Workflow calls XGBoost API
3. **Intelligent Routing** → Agent autonomously decides which guidelines to search
4. **Hybrid Search** → Combines vector + keyword search for accuracy
5. **Evidence Synthesis** → Generates structured clinical report

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Autonomous Multi-Step Reasoning

The agent independently decides which tools to use based on patient data. When it sees "high blood pressure," it automatically searches hypertension guidelines—no hardcoded if-then statements.

### 🔍 Hybrid Search Excellence

Combines semantic vector search with BM25 keyword matching:
- **Vector search:** Understands medical concepts
- **BM25:** Catches specific clinical terms
- **Result:** 30% better accuracy than either alone

### 📊 ML Risk Prediction with SHAP

- XGBoost model trained on 50,000+ patients
- SHAP values explain each prediction
- Top risk factors ranked by importance

### 📚 Evidence-Based Citations

Every recommendation includes:
- Clinical guideline citation (Class I/IIa/etc.)
- Level of evidence (A/B-R/C)
- Supporting research (PMID)

### ⚡ Production-Ready Performance

- **Response time:** 8 seconds average
- **Search latency:** <1 second
- **Indexed documents:** 10,000+
- **Concurrent users:** Scalable with Elasticsearch

       Supporting: SPRINT trial [PMID: 26551272]
    
    2. Start statin therapy, target LDL <100 mg/dL
       [2018 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline, Class I]
    
    3. Smoking cessation with counseling + medication
       [2019 ACC/AHA Primary Prevention, Class I]
```

```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` and fill in patient data.

### Via Agent Builder Chat

```
User: "Assess CVD risk for 58-year-old male, BP 165/95, 
      high cholesterol, smoker, BMI 30"

Agent: [Autonomously calls ML model → searches guidelines → 
        retrieves research → synthesizes report]
```

---

## 🔄 Workflow

### Input Schema

The agent expects structured patient data:

```python
{
  "gender": 1 or 2,           # 1=Female, 2=Male
  "age_years": int,           # Age in years
  "height": int,              # cm
  "weight": float,            # kg
  "ap_hi": int,               # Systolic BP (mmHg)
  "ap_lo": int,               # Diastolic BP (mmHg)
  "cholesterol": 1/2/3,       # 1=normal, 2=above, 3=well above
  "gluc": 1/2/3,              # Glucose level
  "smoke": 0 or 1,            # Smoking status
  "alco": 0 or 1,             # Alcohol consumption
  "active": 0 or 1            # Physical activity
}
```

**Derived features** (calculated automatically):
- BMI = weight / (height/100)²
- Pulse pressure = systolic - diastolic
- Mean arterial pressure = (systolic + 2×diastolic) / 3

### Agent Execution Steps

1. **Risk Prediction** → Calls ML API, gets risk score + SHAP values
2. **Topic Mapping** → Maps risk factors to clinical topics (e.g., high BP → "Hypertension")
3. **Guideline Search** → ES|QL query on guidelines index
4. **Research Search** → Hybrid search on PubMed index
5. **Synthesis** → Combines all sources into structured report

### Output Format

```markdown
## RISK SUMMARY
- Risk: 78% (HIGH)
- Category: Requires immediate intervention

## PRIMARY RISK FACTORS
1. Systolic BP 165 mmHg (35% contribution) - Stage 2 HTN
2. Cholesterol well above normal (28% contribution)
3. Active smoking (15% contribution)

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Chunking Long Clinical Guidelines

**Problem:** 500-page guidelines exceeded token limits  
**Solution:** Intelligent chunking by recommendation sections, preserving semantic meaning  
**Elasticsearch Help:** Token limits forced better preprocessing  

### Challenge 2: Citation Accuracy

**Problem:** Early versions hallucinated PMID numbers  
**Solution:** Configured agent to only cite metadata from retrieved documents  
**Elasticsearch Help:** Rich metadata in search results prevented hallucinations  

### Challenge 3: Balancing Speed vs Comprehensiveness

**Problem:** Initial 30-second response time too slow  
**Solution:** ES|QL optimization + top-5 result limiting  
**Result:** 4x speedup (30s → 8s) without quality loss
